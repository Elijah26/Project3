  		<p>In this page, you can find everything you need about this website.</p>
  		<p>This website is for back to school shopping. We all hate back to school shopping due to how crowded it usually is and not all stores have all the supplies you need.</p>
  		<p>We are overstocked with school supplies and are early on devoplement for this website. This mean not all back to school supplies are on here but the main essentials are.</p>
